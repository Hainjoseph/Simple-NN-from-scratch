# Simple-NN-from-scratch

This is a simple two-layer neural network trained on the MNIST digit recognizer dataset.This NN has a simple two-layer architecture. Input layer  a[0]  will have 784 units corresponding to the 784 pixels in each 28x28 input image. A hidden layer  a[1]  will have 10 units with ReLU activation, and finally our output layer  a[2]  will have 10 units corresponding to the ten digit classes with softmax activation.
